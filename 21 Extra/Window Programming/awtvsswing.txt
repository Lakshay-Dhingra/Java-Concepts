  swing  :  is a GUI API that is  platform independent and completely written in java

                Diff. between  awt and swing

        awt components are not platform independent in terms of their look and feel
        where as swing components are platform independent in terms of their look and  feel
 
         swing components have richer functionality as compared to awt  components
             
          look and feel of  swing components will remain consistent across diff. 
         operating system.. same will not happen with awt components

          swing components are also known as light weight components
          where as  awt components are known as heavy weight components

          awt is the older version for    GUI  API in java
          swing is newer version for  GUI  API  in java

           all swing based component classes  are present in    javax.swing  package
         
           to distiguish components class from awt   you will see  "J"  in front
           all components classes
                       e.g
                                  awt                                     swing
                             Button                                  JButton
                             Frame                                  JFrame
                             TextField                             JTextField
                             TextArea                              JTextArea
                             Label                                    JLabel 

       to  perform  event handling  in swing there is no change at all  u can use
       awt.event package as it's  ... but for some new  swing components  
       they provides  some additional  listener interfaces  are present in 
       javax.swing.event  package.
