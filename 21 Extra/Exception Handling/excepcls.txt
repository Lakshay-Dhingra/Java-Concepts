 ClassNotFoundException
when we request to load a class
but no definition for the same class with the specified name could be found.

   InstantiationException
  when an application tries to create an instance of a class using the "new"   but the specified class object
 cannot be instantiated because it is an     interface or is an abstract class.

IllegalAccessException
 IllegalAccessException is thrown when an application tries to reflectively create 
an instance (other than an array), set or get a field, or invoke a method, but the currently executing method 
does not have access to the definition of the specified class, field, method or constructor. 

NoSuchMethodException
 ExceptionThrown when a particular method cannot be found. 

NoSuchFieldException
 Signals that the class doesn't have a field of a specified name. 

 some popular subclasses of RuntimeException are as under

  ArithmeticException
  represent  exceptional arithmetic condition has occurred.
  For example, an integer "divide by zero" throws an instance of this class. 
    ArrayStoreException
    indicate that an attempt has been made to store the wrong type of object     into an array of objects. 
    e.g  we take array of int and tries to store string with in it.

   NullPointerException
   Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object    is required. 
  
   ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
   Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index.   
   The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the     array. 

   Some common class of Error are as under
   VirtualMachineError
   Thrown to indicate that the Java Virtual Machine is broken or has run out    
   of resources necessary for it to continue operating. 

   OutOfMemoryError
     OutOfMemoryError  is thrown when the Java Virtual Machine cannot allocate  memory  to 
     an object because it is out of memory, and no more memory could be made 
     available by the garbage collector. 

   StackOverflowError
   Thrown when a stack overflow occurs because an application recurses too  deeply.
