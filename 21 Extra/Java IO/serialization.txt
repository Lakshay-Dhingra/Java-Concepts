     persisting  object data  to secondary storage device  .... 
           concept of  object  serialization :

Serialization  :  process of storing / writing  state of an object to and from  byte oriented stream
 is known as  serialization

  this is useful  when you want to save the state of your object to persistant storage.area such as
 file. and at later time we can restore these objects by using the process of deserialization
  
 using concept of  serialization we can  also  send object data on  a network.

to  perform    object serialization   java  provides us   2  built in  high level  stream classes
     1  ObjectOutputStream  and           2 ObjectInputStream


 Serializable :  The object that implements the Serializable interface can be saved or 
                        restored by the serialization facility. The Serializable interface do not contains 
                        any no. of member. (such kind of interface are known as marker interface)

                        It is simply used to indicate that a class is serialized.

                         If a class is serializable then all of it's subclasses are also seriablizable.

  Note :   static datamembers of an java class object never persisted as they are not the
               part  of object data  where they represent class data.


//   from   java  io  point of  view    following   high level  stream  classes are  used   for  object persistance.

      ObjectOutputStream : can be used to save object data.
      ObjectInputStream   : can be used to read object data back.. 

    // lets  understand  above   with  following  e.g 
    //   at first  create   some  simple java class and     implemenents   Serializable  interface with in it...
