                                               Multithreaded  Programming  using  java
             ability of executing more thn one  task on  concurrent  basis  is  known  as  multithreading
        or
             ability of executing more thn one  sections  or modules  of java application 
            on  concurrent  basis  is  known  as  multithreading

####################################################################################################################################################################################
             
	    to  under stand  multithreading   at first lets revise some basic  terminologies of   o/s
             Multitasking :
                   ability of  operating system to executed more then one task simultaneously is known as multitasking.
                   all modern  o/s  supports concept of multitasking.
                   e.g   linux /  window / apple mac  etc.
                    over these  o/s  we can run n number of  application  concurrently 
                    e.g  we  can play winamp or  g chorme   or word  on cncurnt basis
                     using  concept of  multitasking  we can exploit cpu time in more efficient manner.
                     multitasking can be thinked as one of the feature of  o/s  .
                      o/s  achv  multitasking    os  uses  concept of  time slicing....  
                    Multitasking  is again of  2 types : 
                          Process based multitasking       Thread based multitasking.

in case of  Process based multitasking  o/s will manage execution of  each process in seperate - 2  address space
        where as in case of  Thread based multitasking  o/s can   manage multiple task with in single  address space
         process based multitasking best suitable when 2 process do not need  resource sharing
         where as if  each process need data of  each other then such kind of  communication of data  
         results in  speed degradation.   to resolve above prob o/s  purpose  Thread based multitasking.
          e.g  of    Process based multitasking is concurrent  execution of   winamp +  intrnt explr +  mspaint
          e.g of    Thread based  multitasking   is  execution of   multiple threads running with in 
                        Word application    i.e    spell chkr  +  printing  +  typing.

	from java  implementation point of  view   thread  is   an   Object
         and  for    the  proper management of   Thread  object  java  provides  us a  built in class  named "Thread'
         fully  qualified name of this  class is    ---     java.lang.Thread 
         in a  java  application  every    thread  is an object of   Thread  class  directly  or  indirectly 
         
	 common    methods  of   Thread class
                       public void   start() ;      used to  start working of  Thread  
                       public  void   stop() ;      used to  stop  execution of currentlly running  thread
                       public  void  setName( String name );      used to   assign a logical name to thread
                       public  String   getName()  ;      used  to  obtain name of  thread
                       public   void  setPriority( int  pr);     used to  change  priority of  thread object
                       public   static  void   sleep (  long  miilis  )  throws InterruptedException
                       public  static  Thread   currentThread(   ) ;  used to  obtain ref. of  thread  Thread object...
                                                                                                 (  from  its  own  working  )
                       public  void  join   ()   throws    InterruptedException  
                                  used to    wait for  another thread    untill   another thread finish  its  working
                       public     void   join (   long   millis  );
                                 used to    wait for  another thread  for specified interval of time
                         public  void  run ()     ;     represent    working of  thread

                      public String getPriority();

                         common   constructor   of  java.lang.Thread  class
                                                               public  Thread()
                                                               public   Thread  (String  thname) ;
                                                               public   Thread   (  Runnable   target  )

steps of  creating   first  thread  based  application
  step1    create   a   simple   java class and  extends it  from  java.lang.Thread class
          now    override        run()  method of   Thread  class  in ur  child class    ( here run()  represents working of Thread )
                 prototype of  run method is as under 
                                                     public void  run( )   {      }
                  write  some  instruction with in  run()  method    

    step2          after  that   create one  more  class in same  fashion and  override     run()  method 

     step 3          after   that  create  another  class with   main ()  method
                          then  create object of   each   class   ( i.e  first and  second  class )
                          and  then   call     start()  method on   each  object.
                          and  then observe  concurrent   execution of    threads.

        Note :   here   run () method  represents  working  of  thread
                       for   every  thread  object   u  are  required to  define  its  working 
                       and  we can  do  the same  only  using  run()  method
                       note :  there are  lots of  ways of   overriding    public void  run() method
                       above  said  is  the  most   typical  way of  defining  working of thread
    we   will  learn   other  method  after  understanding   lyfcycle of   thread

     some other  defi. of  Thread
             Thread  :   execution  path  of a  program  is known as  Thread

             till now  in  our  all application  we observe  single  path of  execution    and because of this
             our  program  does only  one  single thing at  a time.

             but some  time  we wants to  perform   more thn one  activities   simultaneously   to do 
             the same  we need  support of  multithreading
